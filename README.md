#Something's broken? This will fix it 99/100 times
```bash
npm install
```

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Renjuju/Checkers.git
```
Go to the Checkers directory
```bash
npm install
```
Then start up the server
```bash
node server.js
```
The site will be up at localhost

#Unit tests!
```bash
npm test
```

#Using Git (Avoid pushing to master)
Let's all not directly push to master to avoid overwriting someone elses code and messy merge conflicts. Instead
```bash
git checkout -b "your branch name"
```
Make our changes for the branch, ideally the branch name being the feature we're working on
Then push to that branch
```bash
git push origin "your branch name"
```
Afterwards, go back to the main repo page on github and we'll see a green button that says "Pull Request"
![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/CBYJXoS.png "Pull request")

Click that and merge the code in from your branch to the master branch
